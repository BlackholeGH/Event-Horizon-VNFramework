# Event-Horizon-VNFramework

The eVent horizoN Framework is a framework for 2D games built using MonoGame. Initially designed for visual novels, the game engine can be used to build any arbitrary 2D project.

eVent horizoN incorporates its own scene control systems, scripting language, resource manifests, stock UI elements, developer console, save/load functionality, custom animation engine and more!

The project is an ongoing work-in-progress that I update periodically. The currently written test software includes one complete game, but this has not been publicly released and the asset files are not included in this Git archive.
